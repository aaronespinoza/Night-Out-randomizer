Have you or your friends wanted to hang out but didn't have an idea on what to do? We all know choosing an activity can be frustrating but with this this application, that decision is made simpler. You are given a radom event and if you don't particlaly like that event, you can always reroll and get a new one. Ultimately, with this application, the chance of arguing with friends about what do to is substanially lowered. This way you can enjoy your nights rather than fuss over the details.

## Usage

- When you open up the page, scroll down to the search bar and type in your city and pick a date and click 'reroll'
- Once clicked, you are shown a random event and restaurant. If you're unhappy with the selection, just hit reroll again and you'll get new results
- If you're happy with the results, use the map below to set a route to the event or restaurant from your location .
- After inputing your 'origin' and 'destination', click directions and you'll be given how many miles and how long the trip will be. 
- And you're all set to have fun!
